## Troubleshooting

### macOS: "App is damaged and can't be opened"

Since this application is not signed with an Apple Developer Certificate, macOS Gatekeeper may block it from running. To fix this:

1. Open **Terminal**.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -cr /Applications/Facebook\ Messenger.app
   ```
3. You should now be able to open the app.
